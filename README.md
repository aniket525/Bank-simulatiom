This C++ program is a simple **Bank Simulation System** that allows users to create and manage either a **Personal Account** or a **Joint Account**. It collects user details such as name, address, PAN number, and account type, validates the information, and lets users set a secure 4-digit PIN. After account creation, the user can perform basic banking operations like **depositing money, withdrawing funds, checking balance, and viewing account details** through an interactive menu. The program uses conditional statements, loops, and input validation to simulate basic banking functions in a console environment.
